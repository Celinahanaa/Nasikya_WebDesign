# Mahanta
Mahanta is a digital platform created specifically to highlight and promote visual arts by various artists. We are here with a strong vision to become a bridge between artists and art lovers through the concept we are promoting, namely "Empowering Interaction". Our platform is specifically designed to expand opportunities for artists to showcase their work to the world, while art lovers can easily explore and appreciate the various works on display. <br> <br> Carrying the theme of interaction, Mahanta is not only an exhibition venue, but also a community where artists can share the stories behind each work they create. Users, both artists and art fans, can interact more closely through comments, discussions and various other forms of creative collaboration. This is a platform that empowers artists to continue creating, while opening a space for art fans to better understand and actively engage with the work they love.
